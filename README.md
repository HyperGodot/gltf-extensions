# OMI GLTF Extensions

This repository is used by the [Open Metaverse Interoperability Group](https://github.com/omigroup/OMI) to develop and document extensions for the [glTF 3D transmission format](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/specification/2.0/README.md).

Extensions in this repository are intended to extend the glTF format with features useful for 3D virtual worlds. These extensions could include things related audio, physics, avatars, animations, behaviors, and more.

Vendor extensions are developed and approved via the W3C Metaverse Interoperability Community Group [process](https://github.com/omigroup/OMI/blob/main/PROCESS.md). Our intentions are to create OMI specific vendor extensions, but common extensions that make sense within the greater glTF community may be proposed to the Khronos 3D Formats Working Group at a later date. Our goal with this repository is to prototype and standardize extensions useful for the portability of 3D metaverse media.
